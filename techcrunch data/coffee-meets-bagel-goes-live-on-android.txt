Coffee Meets Bagel, the dating service that asks for patience and, in return, offers something real, has launched on Android.Coffee Meets Bagel is one of the few dating services that does things differently. Its not about an endless browsing experience where you subject countless photos to your own judgement, then go fishing with a sexy one-liner, and maybe perhaps get an answer back. Instead, Coffee Meets Bagel only serves users one match per day, based on connections through Facebook or in that users social graph.When a match is offered, and both users say yes, Coffee Meets Bagel sets up a date between the two potential lovebirds at a discount.If theres no compatibility, based on info like age, profile pic, and a short bio, then the user must wait another 24 hours for another potential match.Coffee Meets Bagel launched on iOS in August of last year and has since seen double-digit growth month-over-month in MAUs. Founder Dawoon Kang says that engagement is around 57 percent monthly, which is impressive.Launching on Android should only foster that, though the landscape is highly competitive these days. Not only is Tinder dominating, but companies like Hinge and Happn are making names for themselves in the dating world. Even Whitney Wolfe is getting in on the action with Bumble.Coffee Meets Bagel is live now on Google Play. You can check it out here or here.

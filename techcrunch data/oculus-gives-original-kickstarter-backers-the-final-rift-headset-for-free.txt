Remember that time Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion, and Kickstarter backers were angry? Kickstarter backers all got a dev kit, but they didnt get anything out of the acquisition. Today, Oculus announced that original Kickstarter backers are also getting a final unit for free.This is a good move for the company as these backers are likely the most enthusiast virtual reality early adopters. Around 7,000 Kickstarter backers got a dev kit, so its a drop in the bucket for the company. Its a great way to promote the new device.Some of them might even be developers. They may have tried the dev kit and forgotten about it since then. Seeing the current state of virtual reality could encourage them to play with the headset again.The Rift ships with Eve: Valkyrie and Luckys Tale, two brand new virtual reality games specifically made for the Rift.As a reminder, Rift preorders open tomorrow. The company plans to ship its unit in Q1 2016. The company has yet to announce the final retail price.Via Engadget

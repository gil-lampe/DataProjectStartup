Every few weeks I dig through the deepest recesses of Kickstarter and Indiegogo to find a few good watches. This time Ive hit pay dirt. The $227 Hastings & Co Heritage Edition is a mechanical watch with enough class and high design to make it an heir to watches like the Tissot Le Locle and some classic Longines pieces at a price that resembles the good old Seiko Orange Monster. But what does all that mean?My main cut-off for a watch is a mechanical movement and an intelligent design. The Heritage has both. Inspired by the Bauhaus movement, the watch looks very understated and readable. It runs a standard 8215 Miyota mechanical movement  think of Miyota as the AMD of movements while ETA is the Intel and features a date window at six oclock. This means youre getting a readable, usable and handsome watch for not much money, because these guys have paid attention to detail  the face is nice, the hands very visible and the band works well with the gold or steel case.The watch is about as Swiss as I am (and Im from Ohio and the company is in Canada) but given the low price, reliability and design Ill let that pass. The company has successfully kickstarted a previous watch called the Classic Edition that is a bit more minimalist with a quartz movement. However, given that this piece has a mechanical movement, is under $300 and looks good, it seems that Hastings & Co is onto something.

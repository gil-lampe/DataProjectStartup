Therisks forbusinessesassociated with storing and processing the personal data of their customers are growing as data volumes continue to increase andregulators sharpen their claws over data protection. But those risks are of course just another startup opportunity.So step forward out ofstealthy shadows BigIDwhichhas been quietly working on a plan to build an enterprise privacy management platform since last fall  with the aim of helping other companies better understand their customer data-relatedrisks.Its building a SaaS tool to improvevisibility of customer data, flagging up where its stored, whos accessing it and so on. Core idea being that you cant protect what you dont know about, says co-founder Dimitri Sirota.He argues there aregrowingreasons for businesses to care about customer data privacy risksgiven, for example, Europes incoming new generaldata protection directive which greatly increasing the penalties companies can face for data breaches.And even beyond move towards stricter data protection legislation, he asserts theres growing customer awareness about data breaches, and threats from class action litigation, meaning enterprises are being incentivized onvarious frontto get their data governance house in order. Which is where BigID wants to come in.The most important assets a company has are the digital identity assets of their customers and right now they dont really have a good system for managing those assets. For understanding where they are, how at risk they are, and how theyre getting used. They do for their laptops, they do for their mobile phones, but they dont for their digital personal information assets  and thats what were solving, Sirota tells TechCrunch.While BigID is not itself planning to sell after-the-fact security solutions to its b2b customers after theyve got to grips with their data assets and figured out what they want to do to lock stuff down, Sirota couches the platform as a preventative solution  in the sense that theyre sellingorganizations visibility into whats radioactive, and what needs attending to when it comes to customer data holdings.What we found is that if you have a particular point of view in how to best interdict that particular activity, ten other companies will have a differing point of view [but] what they all have in common is that they just need better understanding and knowledge around whats at risk, and how to best track compliance, he says.So for the time being were going after all customers  the need that they all have  to give them a better understanding as to their posture around privacy and personal data protection. And then they have the option to figure out how to secure it. And whats good about that for us is its a lot easier of a sell.The co-founders, who have a background in identity management  includingSirota having sold a prior startup, Layer 7 Technologies, to CA Technologies, after which he worked as CAshead of security strategy for two years  begunworking on the idea for BigID last fall.Today they are announcing a $2.1 million seed round to get theirplatform to market, with a slated aim of launching in September.Investors in the roundinclude enterprise focused seed funds Genacast Ventures, BOLDstart Ventures, and Deep Fork Capital.Right now Sirota says they arein talks with companies to start running pilots, so havent yet started beta testing.So how exactly will BigID beable to surface all the relevant at risk data for its customers? Sirota says the core tech is a big data mining system with some added algorithmic secret sauce.We mine primary data sources  i.e. databases  but theres been technologies that crawl data sources for a number of years. On top of that we mine secondary data sources like logs and DMP [data management platforms]. And essentially we get a perspective on where that information resides. Again we get other attributes around that information, in terms of how longits been there, since its been last touched, whether its in the DMP or not, he explains.From there BigIDs platform will generate what he dubs three kinds of maps for its users: an identity map/identity graph, a risk profile around that map, and a usage view/activity view around how the data is getting accessed.Essentially were a big data solution but with a very specificity around personal information, he adds. The traditional solutions for [data] discovery have a very high false positive rate. But were leveraging the fact that most organizations have one, two, three sources of definitive or authoritative information about you it could be in a CRM, it could be in a directory, it could be in a relational database but you start off with something. And so we leverage that to essentially bootstrap the system.So we dont start off with zero knowledge. We start off with some very specific knowledge and then we have algorithms to essentially expand, find additional copies of information and expand additional  not just instances, but additional attributes.The BigID platform will be offered as an on premise solution for what the teamenvisages will be the majority of its customers (larger enterprises) although Sirota says it does also plan to offer the tool as a cloud service forsmaller businesses thatdont want to manage the platformthemselves.Were not creating anotherdatabase of all the personal information, he says, when asked why its customers should trust BigID to handle their data. Its a toolset that they use, think of it as a private cloud that they run internal to their own datacenter, that gives them better visibility, understanding of risk and compliance.Its not so much that they have to trust us with their data  were basically facilitating the people that they already trust, or supposedly trust, to do a better job, to be able to answer questions they have around their information and be able to do that quickly  and we think thats important.

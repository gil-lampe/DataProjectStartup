If you love Star Wars have we got a 3D printing project for you. MontyBug of the BB8BuildersClub has posted a build record of his model BB-8 droid. The droid is made of 3D printed parts and a little Arduino board to run his lights and Monty spent hours sanding and filling the surfaces. Each piece is separately 3D printed and glued together and the whole thing is about the coolest thing Ive ever seen.Sadly the little guy doesnt roll just yet but Monty is working on it.Monty is part of the BB-8 Builders Club, a closed Facebook group apparently dedicated to not making BB-8 (although they really are. I suspect it has something to do with litigious Lucasfilm.) The project consists of 100 parts and took 900 hours to print. You can check out an entire series of build videos here or simply bask in the glory of a jolly selection of build images here. Regardless, let the Force live long and prosper. Boop tweet!

Instagram began as a mobile-only service, but now its enhancing its web version so you can use the service without opening your phone. Today Instagram rolled out an Activity tab on web thats identical to the notifications tab inside its app. Here youll be able to see who Liked or commented on your posts, or who followed you or tagged you. Its now available to all users.We were first tipped off about the launch by Rob Poitras. The move follows Snapchat, another mobile-only-at-first service, bringing its Live stories about newsworthy events to the weblast month.Instagram first launched user profiles on the web in 2012, followed by a scrollable feed with Likes and comments in 2013, and search last year.Instagram declined to comment regarding whether this was part of a bigger push on the web, so this seems like more of a one-off feature addition. But making Instagram more cross-platform enhances its ubiquity and network effect. That could grow its moat and make sure no other service usurps it as the hot permanent photo sharing app.

Okay, be honest. How many of you dreamed of becoming an astronaut when you were a kid? I certainly did  and in my heart of hearts, I still kind of regret that it didnt happen.Well, that might not be as unrealistic as you might think, at least according to a new ad from LinkedIn. The company says this is actually its very first TV ad, and it will air during the Academy Awards.The message of the ad has less to do with signing up for LinkedIn and more to do with that dream of becoming an astronaut. In a blog post, Vice President of Marketing Nick Bartle said LinkedIn is working with NASA to find their next astronaut (!), and in the process, it discovered that 3 million of the sites US users are actually qualified:
Our data shows that many of your aspirations, even the ones that seem like unattainable dreams, are actually achievable. LinkedIn exists to help you pursue those careers that fill you with a sense of purpose. Were endeavoring to redefine what it means to be well connected, so that you can achieve your vision.The ad comes after LinkedIn reported that it has 414 million members and 100 million unique visitors each month. (Its stock price took a big dive after the earnings report due to a disappointing outlook and guidance.)

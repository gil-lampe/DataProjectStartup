Another dispatchfrom the mobile messaging is eating the world file: Blue-collar recruitment app and European startupCornerJob has closed a $10 million Series A funding round.The app, which launched in Italy in September last year and has since expanded to France, Spain and Mexico,focuses on low-skill, high-turnover recruitment, and aims to streamlinethe hiring and job-search process via a lightweight mobile app that lets employers advertisejobs via its location-based app platform, and shortlist and chat with potential recruits. From the job seekers flip-side, it offers location-based job search, whichcan be filtered by sector.At this nascent stage itsnot breaking out active user metrics  saying only that its app is getting 500,000 downloads per month, and publishing up to 4,000 new job offers per week. Italy and France are itsmain markets currently, with Spain a recent addition.CornerJobtouts simplicity and immediacy as the core USP of its matching platform, which does not vet or authenticate the individuals using it but aims to quickly link businesses with potential employees to get the ball rolling  the idea being more detailed checks can be done by employersonce they have determined their shortlist of candidates via the app.Recruiters and pre-selected jobseekers chat via the CornerJobmessaging interface to determine suitability for interview. Unsuccessful job seekers are at least toldwithin 24 hours whether they have been pre-selected for arole for which they have applied.As youd expect, the messaging app includesfeatures tailored for itsrecruitment niche  such as the ability for businesses or candidates to be anonymous.Everything were doing in product is made to make this work, says co-founder and CEODavid Rodriguez, formerly of Hailo, discussing how CornerJob aims tostave off the risk of heavy-handed competition in the form of messaging giant WhatsApps own nascent interest in the B2C comms space. (Last month WhatsApp said it was testing business accounts, for example.)The whole environment is built around this. Having a history of candidates, what theyve applied to, all the intelligence were putting in the algorithm to do a proper matching. Having the wallof offers which is adapted to the navigation youve had before, what youve been pre-selected for. Theres a lot of intelligence were bringing into the algorithms and the candidates and on the employer side.So WhatsApp, obviously, and other players might end up doing similar things in the long run but thats not their main focus, he adds.At this point, CornerJobs candidate-employer matching smarts arelargely based on location, freshness of job ad and any role/sector filters specifiedby users. But in the future, the aim is to inject a little more data-based intelligence into the processby analyzing usage of the platform to better customize matching to users, according toRodriguez.What were doing is working on a few elements for now of the algorithm; three of them at this stage but were adding more and more parameters to this algorithm Id say this is the beginning of the personalization and matching history but were already doing it, he tells TechCrunch.Perhaps non-coincidentally, justlast month Accel led a $10 million Series A round in rival blue-collar jobs app Job Today, which launched a little earlier than CornerJob but is in fewer markets (currently its nationwide in Spain, and recentlylaunched in Paris and London). Safe to say, the race to be the go-to mobile app for blue-collar jobsis on.WhileCornerJobs co-founders argue they are aiming toserve a wider breadth of jobs than Job Today  from service industry staff to construction, logistics, sales, events staff, holiday reps and more Job Today saysits key sectors include retail, hospitality, delivery drivers/logistics and the beauty industry, so theres plenty ofoverlap here.CornerJob also claimsits morefocused on largeremployers with highervolumes of blue-collarjobsversusJob Today chasingthe long tail of small businesses withmore modest staff needs. For example,its encouragingrecruitment and tempting agencies to use its platform.If you look at our portfolio of people who are using us at the moment its a lot of great big brands, saysRodriguez, name-checking the likes of McDonalds and Burger King and also noting public sector institutions are making use of the platform.We really want to be the one-stop shop for blue collar work and high rotation jobs, he adds.While Job Today can tout well-knownEuropean VC Accel as a backer, CornerJob hasa roster of regional investors for its Series A, hailing from the marketswhere itsappis currently operational. Investors includeAntai Business Angels and Mediaset (through its media for equity subsidiary Ad4Ventures), VCfunds from Sabadell Capital, Bonsai Venture Capital, Cube Investments, Ithaca Investment, Samaipata Ventures (founders of La Nevera Roja), La Caixa Capital Risc and Media Digital Ventures. The company has also received an equity loan from Enisa.As is clear from that investorlist, CornerJob is also ploughing a regionalmedia for equity furrow, although the co-founders specify thatmost of the Series A is cash, rather than media.This is a round mixed cash and media We are in four markets and we are doing the part of media in two markets. I cannot give you the proportion [that is media for equity] but its mainly cash, notesco-founderGerard Oliv.The Barcelona-based startupwas founded in April 2015, going through the same venture builder vehicle (Antai) as Spanish mobile marketplace classifieds app Wallapop. The latter also utilizeda media for equity route to grab exposure and scale its network in Spain (and is now seeking to repeat this trickin the U.S.)  ballooning in popularity in its home marketas a result and reportedlyattracting some serious international investor attention.We love media for equity agreements. Thats something that we had before in different startups that were launching in Antai  like Wallapop, saysco-founderMiguel Vicente.We strongly believe in building strong brands, so building that brand awareness and using offline media like TV, adds Oliv, its part of our playbook.CornerJob has TV ads running in Italy now, and will be kicking offa TV campaign in Spain soon, according toVicente.This is a marketplace, and we are not focused on one specific segment  like restaurants or hotels  we are blue collar and we have a wide range of different sectors we are covering, like retail services, logistics, industry/construction, so we believe the best way to scale this business is through TV ads, together of course with investment in social networks like Facebook, he adds.The team says the Series A roundwillbe used for more than just TV spots and brand-builder marketing, soproduct investment and team expansion are in the cards too. But no more market launches at this point; rather the aim is to double-down on its existingfootprint.And, as befits a marketplace startup looking to scale up fast, CornerJob is not currently taking anyrevenue  allowingeven recruitment agencies to trial itsplatform for free.It says its future business model is yet to be fully determined, with the team considering various pricing structuresfor eventual monetization. They saythey will likely not be taking the traditional job board route of charging for job adverts, but are more likely tofocus on performance. So, presumably, something along the lines of charging employers for shortlisted candidates or successful hires. They confirm they are tracking hires, but wont put a figure on how many blue-collar workers have gained employment via their platform as yet.How did they come up with the idea? The team says they drew on their existingexperience at other startups such as Wallapop and Hailo  in the latter case, seeing how a traditional industry could be completely disrupted thanks to mobile, and all frictions put away create a new experience, asRodriguez puts it. (And, in the case of Wallapop, seeinghow mobile pluslocation can transform classifieds.)The blue-collar recruitment space also looked like an untapped opportunity, saysVicente. Traditional job classifieds have been focused on white collar. So we thought that there was a really interesting space, that no one had developed specific functionalities around.And we all thought we were from countries  Italy, Spain, France  where unemployment was quite severe for young generations and so we thought maybe theres something we can do here with the learning weve taken from our past experiences, adds Rodriguez. Working to improve the situation is something quite exciting.

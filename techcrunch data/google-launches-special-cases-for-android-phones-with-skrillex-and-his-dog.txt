Google has introduced a new limited run of Android device accessories called Edition cases. These cases, which come in sizes compatible with Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 4, also come with a live wallpaper to match which displays satellite-captured images of Earth by night and constellation pics from the night sky of your current location by night.This Google accessory project is kicking off with a partnership with Skrillex, the side-buzzed electronic noise musician the kids all love these days. The case designs come in three unique patterns created by Skrillex, in between his time producing unnatural sounds for high-volume playback in the club.He didnt just make the art, however; the satellite images for the live wallpaper that comes with these accessories is actually fed from a Google and Skrillex custom balloon satellite named after the artists dog Nanou. Once its done snapping pics, one lucky @Android Twitter account follower will actually win Nanou (the satellite, not the dog). Im not making any of this up.Live Cases also ship with a free album, as well as one-touch transport directly to Skrillexs YouTube music channel via a hardware button on the actual case (though you can fix this to do useful things like open your favorite apps). The cases are only available to buy via the Google Play Store, and only while supplies last through the end of June.It looks like Google intends to do more Edition partnership, however, so stay tuned for whoever comes next. Maybe Taylor and her cats?

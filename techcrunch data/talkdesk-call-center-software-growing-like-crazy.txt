Talkdesk co-founder Cristina Fonseca spoke at Disrupt London on Tuesday. In an interview with TechCrunchs Matt Lynley, Fonseca explained how the San Francisco-based company that started in Portugal has helpedbusinesses improve their customer service experience.Founded in 2011, in an effort to win a Macbook Air contest, Talkdesk has quickly scaled its call center business. Its software is used by companies like Dropbox, and enables companies to get a quick overview of a customers profile and previous interactions as soon as they accept an incoming call.With Talkdesk, you can see everything about a customer when that customer is calling, said Fonseca.Talkdesk has positioned itself as a low-cost and efficient solution for businesses who still rely heavily on phone for customer service. The platform seamlessly integrates with other business software including Salesforce, Zendesk and Shopify.Fonseca said at Disrupt that the company is growing like crazy and looks to expand beyond calling, and will incorporate services such as chat, email, and video. Talkdesk aims to be a modern solution that takes care of a problem for todays companies.Headquartered in San Francisco, Fonseca said that the companys Portugal location has been advantageous, because the local schools graduate top engineering talent. But she said that Talkdesk has focused its sales and marketing efforts in the United States, because there are more potential clients there.Talkdesk has raised over $24 million from Salesforce Ventures, 500 Startups, DFJ and others.

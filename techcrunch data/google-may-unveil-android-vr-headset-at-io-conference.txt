According to multiple rumors and a newly spotted placeholder on the Google Play Developer Console, it seems that Google will be unveiling an Android VR headset at Google I/O next week.Android Police first spotted the placeholder, which is currently just that  you cant click into the link like you would be able to with the Android Wear, Android TV, or Android Auto.Last week, Peter Rojas (former Engadget Editor and current EIR at Betaworks) confirmed the rumors via Twitter, noting that Android VR wouldnt be as powerful as the Vive from HTC or the Oculus Rift.Android VR will definitely be announced next week, and from what Ive heard will be less powerful than the Vive or Rift.

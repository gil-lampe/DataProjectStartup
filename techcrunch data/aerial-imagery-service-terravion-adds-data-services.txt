There has been a lot of hype around using dronesin precision agriculture, but for the time being, using regular planes outfitted with specialized cameras is still a more cost-effective way to cover wide swaths of land. YC-backed TerrAvion made an early bet onusing planes for aerial imaging for precision agriculture; after a few growing seasons, its now expanding its service by also adding alayer of quantitative analysis on top of its images.TerrAvion currently covers a number of major growing regions, including areas in California, Oregon, Washington state and the Great Plains. As the companys CEO and co-founder Robert Morris tells me, it has now also set its sights on the wine-growing regions of Spain.Morris argues that TerrAvion alone currently covers 100x more acreagethan the whole drone industry, while offering a very similar resolution at a comparable (or better) cost point.Traditionally, TerrAvion has provided growers with lots of imagery, but now its adding a statistical layer on top of that based on its own image analysis. We now process a bunch of statistics that most growers want, Morris said, and noted that it would usually take an in-house geographic information systems specialist to process this data, but for now, TerrAvion is offering this new service, which it calls Digest, for free.Basically, Digest takes what TerrAvion does best  giving growers a comprehensive up-to-date picture of whats happening on their farm, allowing them to take immediate action  and brings this into the quantitative realm, Morris told me. Visual control revolutionized indoor manufacturing. NowTerrAvion is not only making that possible in agriculture, but were also putting a quantitative layer on top of that visual control.Farmers can then take this data and reuse it across any other service. Growers are very sophisticated as tech integrators, Morris said. Because of this, they are much more sensitive to things like being able to reuse data and having the choice to change IT providers.

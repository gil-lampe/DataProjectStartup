Dear Hotlanta (which happens to be freezing right now),I write to you from a hotel room off of the highway, with but a few short hours until I head over to Prive to host the TC Meetup + Pitch-off. I am excited to see many of your smiling faces again, but I write with concern, as there are still tickets left to be bought. Atlanta, you are one of the longest-running meetups in TechCrunch history. If the meetups were my children (and lets be honest, it feels that way), you would be my eldest. And as my first and favorite child, I come to you with a friendly reminder:This is your last chance to buy tickets to the TC Meetup + Pitch-off tonight.Its going down at 6pm at Prive, where ten companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their wares to a panel of expert judges. So, dear Atlanta, I implore you to brave the cold and come see me tonight. Buy tickets here. Sincerely yours,
Jordan

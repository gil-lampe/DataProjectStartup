This has been quite a few past couple of weeks for Twitter, with a new CEO, a renewed double-down promise to developers, love to its employees (after some tough love by way of layoffs), Ballmer being in for 4 percentand more.The street agrees, with Twitter stock jumping up 5 percent today.Twitter, which is a notoriously volatile stock, for a variety of reasons (including lack of substantial growth) might be hitting its new norm at the $30 level, well above what it was priced at when it when it went public.This is even after the downgrade that rocked them this week. Its even edging back towards a buy.As for me: I'd rather have a smaller part of something big than a bigger part of something small. I'm confident we can make Twitter big!

But the simple fact that the stock looks like it does today, the company is in a way more stable place than it was when Costolo stepped down.Its next quarter earnings are next week (10/27) and well probably hear a little bit of give us some time on growth and were still killing it on revenue, so Dorsey has time to keep things going on the up swing.Smoke and mirrors or real change? Well soon find out.

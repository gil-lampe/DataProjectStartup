During the 2015 Special Olympics World Games in Los Angeles last week, a fifth grader named Ari stopped by a booth set up by Google. The booth had information about its Impact Challenge for disabilities. What Ari didnt know is that her life would change before she left the games.A few volunteers from AIO Robotics swung by and fitted Ari for a new colorful prosthetic hand, since she was born without fingers on the left one. The broader appeal of the booth was a demo from a group called e-NABLE, which is a network of volunteers printing 3D prosthetics for kids specifically.Hopefully you caught Aris mega-huge smile as soon as they fitted her with the bright-pink prosthetic. Go ahead, watch it again.Okay, okay. One more? How about eight-year-old Isabella being gifted a brand new hand thanks to e-NABLE:Isnt technology awesome?

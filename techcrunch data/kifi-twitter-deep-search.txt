A startup called Kifi is rolling out a new tool that allows you to automatically save all the links you tweet in order to create a personalized search engine that includes those links as well as others it recommends based on what youve already shared. Called Kifi for Twitter, the company describes the new feature as something of a deep search engine for Twitter because its not only indexing the tweet itself, but also the actual content contained inthose links youve shared, allowing you to more easily retrieve this information in the future.ExplainsMark Yoshitake,VP of Product at Kifi, one of the huge problems that weve found is that people have a hard time recalling the wealth of information theyve found and shared on social networks.As you probably know, if youre not regularly engaged on social media and keeping an eye on your many streams, then information often justgets missed. That can leavepeople feeling stuck in between two extremes  either you stop paying attention to social media entirely and begin tofeel like youre missing out, or you stay tuned in but then have to deal with the pressures of information overload.In fact, social mediasunfortunate tendency to be biased towards the recency of content is what Kifis aiming to attack with its product. Kifi for Twitter runs in the background, requiring little effort on your part, but can then pull back the right information when you need it.With Kifis technology, youre currentlyable to save the links you tweet and their content, but the company wants to automatically save the content you share on other networks, too, like Facebook and LinkedIn.However,Kifi is not some glorified, automated alternative to bookmarking links usingyour web browser. Instead, the idea is to analyzethe content found withinthose links in order to make recommendations of related items you may be interested in.This part is a lot likehow YouTube makes suggestions of related videos to watch, for example.In addition, Kifi also tracks peoplewhocollect similar things, so itcan analyze and filter that content, as well, in order to improve its recommendations.Its essentially an interest graph plus a people graph and a topic graph all integrated together, saysYoshitake, referring to the ways it puts all its collected data together. The startup is also filing patents on itsengine (dubbed Cortex) and its associated algorithm called HelpRank (because its about how helpful you can be to another person in Kifis network.)To retrieve the content Kifi collects, the company creates a word cloud of suggested searches you can access directly. For instance, heres Greylocks Josh Elmanslibrary of Twitter shares.And heres one based onTechCrunch tweets.In addition, Kifi also offers a Chrome browser extension, which will return any link youve tweeted before along with other personalized recommendations. When you do a search on Google.com, for instance, Kifis extension will inject these links at the top of your search results (see below).You can also search across Kifi and Google via the companys mobile apps for iOS and Android.The Chrome extension has been available for around a year and a half now, as Kifi had earlier been developing its social network for knowledge which allows users to save links from around the web to various collections, sort of likea Pinterest for articles. Kifi would then index and analyze all the words on each link so it could be retrieved in future searches.To date, Kifi has grown toover 60,000 users, but its recommendation engine andfull integration with social networks is only a couple of months old.Meanwhile, the deep search functionality for Twitter has only been live for a few days now, but its already gaining a couple of thousand users per day, the company claims. (The feature currently has a waitlist, but TechCrunch readers can gain early access by signing up via this link.)Kifis team includes CEO Dan Blumenfeld, previously the CMO at Check (acquired by Intuit); Eishay Smith, formerlythe Director of Engineering at Wealthfront, also previously of IBM, Netflix and LinkedIn; Jared Jacobs, an ex-Googler who co-led Gmails frontend team; Mark Yoshitake, the co-founder of Google Cultural Institute who also launched Google Book Search and is the ex-head of Platforms at YouTube; as well as a number of other data science and machine learning Ph.Ds and other ex-Googlers.Kifistechnology, while robust, is something that may be hard to scale to a mainstream audience, given that many people arent active Twitter users, nor have a burning desire to catalog their many shared links. Instead, Kifiseems to make sense more for Twitter power users  people like those in the media or researchers, for example.In fact, it would almost be preferable to see Kifi baked into Twitter itself, improving Twitters own search functionalityby giving it a way to better retrieve the links users tweet by better understanding the content they contain.The startupis currently backed by $11 million in bridge and Series A funding from Wicklow Capital,SGVC,Oren Zeev (Chegg, Houzz); Audible founder Donald Katz, Richard Sarnoff, Mohan Gyani, Gary Ginsberg,Liron Petrushka, and other angel investors.

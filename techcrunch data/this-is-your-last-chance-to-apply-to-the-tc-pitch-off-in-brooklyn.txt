The Brooklyn Meetup is creeping up on us much faster than expected, which means that there is a very short amount of time before the window closes for applications.And by short amount of time, I mean one day.The TC Meetup + Pitch-off in Brooklyn is going down on March 1, at which point ten companies will have the chance to pitch their product to the audience and a panel of expert VC judges. The catch? They only have sixty seconds to get their point across.Applications for one of those ten slots close tomorrow afternoon, so if you are an early-stage entrepreneur whos looking to pick up new users or impress some VCs, this could be the opportunity for you.Apply here.Tickets are also still on sale to the event, which is to be held at Output in Williamsburg.You can buy tickets here.Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.

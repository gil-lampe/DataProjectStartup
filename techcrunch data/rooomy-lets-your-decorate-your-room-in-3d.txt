Launching today, Rooomy is an iPad app which lets you turn 2D images of a room into a 3D space. You can also decorate these 3D roomswith over 500 pieces of virtual 3D furniture from popular brands like Design Within Reach and All Modern.Built by Loft-NedSense, a European company listed on the NYSE Euronext, the appis mainly designed to beas a virtual staging solution for the real estate industry.Here is how the service works: Real estate brokersupload photos of rooms for a flat fee of $20 per property. After using in a built-in tool to identify where the walls in the room are, it is turned into a 3D model. Potential buyers can then browsehomes for sale within the app, and explore the furnished rooms before scheduling a showing.The brokers can then either choose to use Rooomys virtual furniture catalogue to stage roomsthemselves, or payLoft-NedSense $79 per room toprofessionally decorate it.While this seems costly, the company explained that the goal is for theirvirtual staging solution toeventually allow brokers to stop renting furniture for actual staging.The company also makes money on an affiliate basis from the large catalogue of virtual furniture it features. For example, if a user likes avirtual couch from Rooomys catalogue, they can click through and purchase it, resulting in a small revenue cut forLoft-NedSense.While the3D furniture catalog is still relatively small at 500 pieces, the company says it plans to expand to over 6,000 pieces of furniture within the next month.The iPad app is availablein the App Store for download now.

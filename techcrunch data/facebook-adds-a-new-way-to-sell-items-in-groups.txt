Facebook on Tuesday announced the addition of a new feature for Facebook Groups designed to make it easier for members of a For Sale group to list their items. The new Sell feature, which is now starting to roll out globally to more groups, will allow members to create a post where you can add a description of the item for sale, set a price and set a pick-up or delivery location.The social network today already hosts tens of millions of groups based around a variety of interests, and For Sale groups are one of the most popular categories. In these groups, members use Facebook as an alternative to something like Craigslist for local selling, or as an alternative to eBay for selling collectibles or other items of broad interest, like books or electronics.Currently, members in these For Sale groups generally post photos and text descriptions of their items, but the addition of the Sell feature will make filling out the necessary information a bit more structured than before. That will go a long way tohelp out group admins, who often have to remind members that theyre required to list a price, for example, or that they need to specify their general location or neighborhood.Fellow group members will also benefit from the addition, as theyll no longer need to comment or message the items owner in order to get basic information about the listing, which can be the case today when sellers forget to add these important details.The problem with the older system is that even these sorts of exploratory comments  the requests for information  can cause the old post to jump up to the top of the Groups page, overshadowing newer listings. Its also frustrating for members who may want to purchase items but need to know if the item is nearby, or ifits only available for pick-up, not delivery.In addition, with the new enhancements, sellers will now be able to mark their posts as Available or Sold, which will help keep groups and their members better informed about which items are for sale and which should be removed. Again, this sort of item management was something that group members were already doing  oftenjust typing in sold in the comments section to alert an admin, or deleting the post as need be. But nowtheres a more official means to designate items as sold.Sellers will also be able to see their catalog of previously sold items by using this feature, Facebook notes. This aidsindividuals likelocal artisans who sell their items to friends and other community members using Facebooks Groups, as is often the case withmany women-owned, home-based businesses which are a popular sub-category of Facebooks For Sale groups.The new Sell feature was previously spotted during pilot testingback in December, and the company then confirmed the feature was in the works in select Facebook Groups. Now the feature is rolling out globally to more Groups on the web, iOS and Android, thoughFacebook says it will happen slowly over the coming months.Group admins can opt to participate in trying the feature first by nominating their Group here.Unfortunately, for now at least, the option for listing items for sale will not be rolled out further to public Pages, for example, which is where a lot of more professional selling takes place today from a number of e-commerce retailers of varying sizes.And while the Sell feature adds more structure to these sorts of Groups on Facebook, the Groups product still needs a number of improvements. Facebookdoesnt yet make it easier for buyers to actually locate items of interest on mobile. In fact, doing a search across a given Group for a particular item, like a sectional sofa or lawnmower, for instance, isnt possible from Facebooks newly launched mobile apps for Groups  its only available on the web.Plus, getting in touch with members who are doing the selling is still a challenge, as private messages to sellers inexplicably default to users Other Inbox on Facebook, which isnt available within Facebook Messenger, and is fairly difficult to get to from mobile period. Still, thatFacebook Groups, and in particular these For Sale groups, have grown to become so popular despite these issues, is a testament to how powerful Facebooks platform is for connecting people.Facebook says that it will continue adding more features that will enhance these For Sale Groups in the months ahead that will make it easier for members to connect with each other, browse and search.

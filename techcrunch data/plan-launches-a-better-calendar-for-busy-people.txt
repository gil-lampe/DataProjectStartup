Today, we have a variety of apps to manage our days  calendars, task lists, reminders, notes, and more. But the apps dont always interoperate, and having the information in separatesilos can make it hard to get a handle on howto properly manage our time, or how our tasks connect. A new application for web and mobile called Plan is launching today to offer a different approach to solving this problem.The idea with Plan is to providea single destination to manage anything that requires your time, but also one that allows you to better visualize how your tasks, meetings, and other projects can fit into the available openings you have onyour schedule.To make this possible, Plan presents a different type of interface than you have with atraditional calendaring application. On the web, it lets youcreate lists of tasks associated with a project or larger goal. Then, on the right-hand side of the screen is your calendar showing your scheduled meetings, appointments and other items, as usual.The simple but also genius trick to better scheduling is that Plan lets you drag your individual tasks from the left-side of the screen directly onto your calendar where they transform into scheduled blocks of time. And by viewing your tasks and calendar side-by-side, its easier to see how and where you can fit your to-dos onto your schedule.Obviously, this setup makes the most sense for busy professionals whose days have to be tightly scheduled in order to get things done.But Plans ease-of-use and minimalist user interface makes the service useful for anyone who just wants an alternative way to manage their calendar, whether thats a student managing their homework schedule, study groups and social lives; a family managing parents and kids schedules; or any other office worker who finds their Google, Apple or Outlook calendar a bit of a hassle.The idea for Plancame from Darshan Desai, a Princeton student who found it difficult to manage his own day using the calendaring applications available today. Desai tells TechCrunch that Plan actually began as a class project  he worked on it for about a year and came to realizethat it had potential to be developed further.Says Desai, with traditional calendaring and to-do applications, everything feels like youre putting out fires as they come. Everythings very ad hoc.Plan takes a different approach to the productivity problem, Desai adds. Its an approach that recognizes that everything that takes time in your day should go into one place  your meetings, your tasks, and everything you do.In addition to the ability to see tasks and your calendar together, and the ability to organize tasks into lists, Plan also lets you look back on how your time was spent via its Insights feature. This will tell you how much time was devoted to a particular task, or larger area of focus.Of course, getting people to adopt a totally new calendar is difficult, which is why Plan today syncs with Google Calendar and will support iCal and Exchange sync in the next release, expected to arrive a couple of months. However, because Plan can sync your tasks back to your main calendar, you wont actually have to use the Google Calendar interface going forward  you can just use Plan.The company has been in private beta with 25,000 users over the past 9 months, and will roll out a couple of features based on user feedback including support for recurring tasks and a native Mac application.The latter will complement the web and iOS version available now.On mobile, the app utilizes long-pressing for its drag-and-drop functionality and other gestures, like swipes, for marking items as to do later, among other things.Plan is a team of three full-time in San Francisco and has a small amount of pre-seed funding.The service is currently free, but will introduce collaborative features for teams (think things like integration with external services, like Github; shared task lists; automated alerting; etc.). These expanded features will be paid, says thefounder.Plan is live today online and on the Apple App Store.

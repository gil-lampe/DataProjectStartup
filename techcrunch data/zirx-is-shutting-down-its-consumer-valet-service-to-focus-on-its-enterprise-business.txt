ZIRX,an on-demand valet startup, is shutting down its consumer serviceat the end of the month, according to an email that the company sent out to ZIRXmembers today. The company confirmed the move in a blog post.However, the company isnt shutting down. ZIRXis shifting its focus to its enterprise service while shuttering its consumer valet service on February 29.In short, the enterprise logistics and fleet business looked like a far better opportunity for the company. Its enterprise business offers management for company vehicle fleets.The move highlights some of the challenges of the on-demand economy  in particular, on-demand parking services that can have tricky margin issues.As these companies grow, they often continue to require additional venture funding, with the hopes that at a large enough scale and with strong enough technology, the businesses will become profitable. It turns out a business that revolves around parking cars on-demand is a tough business to run.Without unlimited resources, its really, really hard to build both a great consumer (B2C) and a great enterprise (B2B) business at the same time, the company said in the email. For these reasons, weve made the tough choice to close our consumer parking service on February 29th, 2016, so we can focus all our energy on our enterprise business.The ZIRXapp gives users on-demand access to valets that will pick up and drop off their cars. They can pay a daily or monthly fee, and ZIRXoffers value-added services like car washes and gassing up. There are other valet services in the market like Luxe, which has raised around $25 million from investors like Google Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.ZIRXhas raised $36.4 million total from investors like Bessemer Venture Partners.

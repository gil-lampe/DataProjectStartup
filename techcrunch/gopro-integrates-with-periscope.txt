Action camera maker GoPro is integrating with Periscope, the livestreaming app from Twitter. Owners of the GoPro HERO4 cameras will be able to broadcast their adventures directly to Periscope.As soon as the GoPro is paired to an iPhone, it will recognize the Periscope app and let users record and share their surroundings with a live audience. (The GoPro will still be able to record the videos for later viewings).The cameras, which are popular with surfers and skiers, also enabled broadcasting onPeriscope-competitor Meerkat last year.And GoPro has a product called the HEROCast, a wireless transmitter geared towards professional broadcasters. Twitter recently announced that it is integrating Periscope into users Twitter feeds. Its unclear how many of Periscopes 10 million accounts are active, but the company claims that more than 40 years of video is watched on Periscope each day.Livestreaming has become a hit with teens, as apps like YouNow continue to gain traction. YouTube and Facebook have also introduced livestreaming, in an effort to capture this growing audience.Both Twitter and GoPro are at a crossroads and the companies are hoping that capitalizing on the livestreaming space will attract some new fans. Slowed user growth meant that Twitter stock posted a record low of $17.02 on Monday, following the departures of several top executives. GoPro stock also hit a rough spot this month whenthe company announced layoffs.GoPro is expected to report earnings next Wednesday and Twitter will report on February 10.

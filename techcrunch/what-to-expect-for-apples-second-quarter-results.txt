Apple will report its second-quarter earnings, and all eyes are going to be on the companys iPhone sales.Thats because the big question for Apple is going to be whether or not iPhone sales have hit a wall and that the company will see a year-over-year decline in revenue, marking a significant moment for the company which has traditionally steadily grown iPhone sales to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue. Last quarter, Apple fell just under what industry watchers were expecting  and now were wondering if theyre poisedtodo it again, and in how dramatic a fashion.There are a number of factors that could go into this, but one important one will be whether or not growth in China has also started to stall as it faces steep competition with cheaper, yet still high-end feeling phones from companies like Xiaomi. The question there is whether Chinese consumers will continue to tolerate the high prices of the iPhone  especially given macroeconomic turmoil. And, of course, the iPhone could have also hit a saturation point.The iPhone is Apples cash cow. Its historically continued to grow with each new model release, but critics are now questioning whether Apple will be able to create new phones that will become absolute blockbusters for the company as it continues to grow.With that growth engine potentially stalling could come the first time that the company would see a decline in revenue rather than its consistent growth. Thats going to be a huge deal for Apple  as investors expected the company to continue growing its smartphone share.With that, Apples going to have to figure out new ways to create value for shareholders and drive new growth for the company. There are a couple of ways to do that. It can create better servicesthat can drive additional revenue, for example. But those have largely been a blip on Apples radar relative to the rest of the business.It can also create new devices that can re-ignite its growth  and there are new devices coming out for the company, for sure, like the Apple Watch, the new Apple TV and the iPhone SE that could provide new avenues for growth. Theres going to be a time lag before it becomes apparent that those are runaway successes. So far, its alsohard to extrapolate the strength of the Apple Watch and Apple TV sales, even as its other segment continues to grow.But even with all that,companys stock hasnt exactly been doing well  its down around 21% on the year. So far, it doesnt seem like investors are confident in the companys ability to innovate (at least, not right now).Then, there are the other usual suspicions for Apple: the Mac could continue to grow incrementally, while iPad sales could continue to decline. Apple will still print money and continue to pay back investors, but even with all that cash it hasnt found a new market for growth just yet. (And, naturally, someones going to ask about the Apple Car on the call. Were looking at you, Gene.)In terms of the iPad, Apple now has two new iPad Pro models in different sizes, one of which came out this quarter. So we wouldnt expect to see strong results from the smaller iPad Pros launch baked into its earnings just yet given that the iPad sales have never really been as strong as the iPhone. Either way, the question will be whether thats going to be flat or go down  and whether Apple has to re-assess its iPad strategy.Like last quarter as well, industry watchers will also be watching the next years guidance. Last quarter, the company forecast its first down quarter in recent memory  and investors are going to be wondering if Apple will do that once again (and again, and again). Thats going to give Apple watchers a better handle on the companys own outlook, and whether Apple itself is feeling the urgency of its situation as it looks to find new huge growth drivers.There are, naturally, other ways that Apple could surprise people. Stocks tend to move based on whether or not the company beats or misses expectations set by industry watchers. So Apple could just make more money than expected, or sell more iPads than expected. But for the most part, the money is probably going to move on the iPhone  and whether Apples strongest driver of growth has begun to stall out.For a split second, Apple was dethroned as the most valuable company in the world by Alphabet. Its since gained a significant distance from the maker of Android, but the question remains: will it be able to continue to holdthat title?

The console war is back for a new holiday season. Microsoft and Sony both announced sales for their gaming consoles.

Microsoft announced on Friday that all bundles would receive a $50 price cut from Thursday, November 26 through Monday, November 30 in the U.S. It means that entry-level bundles with a 500GB console and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition or The Lego Movie will cost $299.Other bundles will also get a price cut in case you want a 1TB console and another game. Microsoft stores, Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Target, Toys R Us and Walmart will reflect the sale.Microsoft has always been pretty aggressive with Black Friday sales when it comes to its consoles. But Sony didnt wait long. Shortly after announcing a permanent price cut to $349, the company matched Microsofts offer for Black Friday.From Friday, November 27 through Monday, November 30 in the U.S. and Canada, youll be able to buy a 500GB PlayStation 4 with the Uncharted collection for $299 (or $369 CAD). You can also expect sales on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Store.As for Nintendo? The Wii U currently costs $299 with Mario Kart 8. But there is no sign of a Black Friday sale. Nintendo was already lagging behind its two competitors, it doesnt look any better for holiday sales this year.

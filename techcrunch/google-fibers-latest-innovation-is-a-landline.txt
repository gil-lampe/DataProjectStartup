Google Fiber may be the holy grail of Internet service for many, but many people still rely on landlines for everyday communication purposes or emergency use. In order to allow its subscribers to sever connections with the old local ISPs and telecoms completely, Google will soon offer home phone service for Fiber subscribers.For $10 a month (phone not included, alas), Fiber Phone will do all the things you (well, not you, TechCrunch reader, but others) have always done with a landline  which is mainly make and receive phone calls.It may seem an anachronism, but if Google aims to be the main or even sole conduit for communication in the areas it is expanding to, it does have to offer this. Otherwise, some (say) CenturyLink subscriber is going to fail to switch because theyd rather keep their phone and have one bill, in spite of poor speeds and service.No word on where Fiber Phone will appear to start, but over time it should be available in all Fiber-powered cities.

The FBI, which just a few days ago was attempting to convince the country of its helplessness in the face of encrypted iPhones, has generously offered its assistance in unlocking an iPhone and iPod for a prosecutor in Arkansas, the Associated Press reports.TechCrunch has contacted the prosecutors office for details, which for the moment are thin on the ground  but the timing seems unlikely to be a coincidence. It was only Monday that the FBI announced it had successfully accessed a phone after saying for months that it couldnt possibly do so  and that Apple was endangering national security by refusing to help.If the unlocking process being used by the FBI is so trivial that it can be offered on short notice to anybody asking nicely, that deeply contradicts the narrative the Justice Department has been building regarding the limitations of law enforcement in accessing encrypted phones.Again, the specific details of the devices (model, OS version, etc.) are unknown, as is the exact nature of the FBIs offered assistance. Until the court, prosecutors office, or defender files or volunteers further information (and well be asking), this is fairly up in the air.

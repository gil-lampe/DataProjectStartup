The company went public in 1991.Qualcomms Arberle cited an interesting statistic, noting that in the eyes of some analysts, 8 billion smartphones will ship between 2014 and 2018. The number matters, as it indicates that what could be the core engine of revenue growth for Qualcomm has headroom  I doubt that many people expect wearables and other gadget niches that the company is working on to provide similarly material top line.Hitting on that concept, Arberle noted that chips from his company are now in more than a billion Android handsets. In its recently concluded fiscal 2014, it shipped 860 million of those chips.Returning to healthcare, the companys freshly announced deals with Walgreens and Novartis put it inside of two sides of healthconsumer and corporate. The company did not discuss any potential financial terms of the arrangements.

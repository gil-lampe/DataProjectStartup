Google Photos broke free of Google+ in May, and in the five months since, it has amassed 100 million monthly active users, the team shared today. That puts it on par with Snapchat, which was around 100 million the last time it shared numbers.During its hardware event last month, Google shared that 50 billion photos had been uploaded already, which is equally impressive.The idea is that Google wants to store every photo and video youve ever taken and let you manage them in an easy way. Along with fun automatic animations and tweaks through its Assistant feature, powered by really smart search technology, scouring through your photos is pretty fun. I currently have about 15,000 of them stored on the platform and use Google Photos on every device I own.

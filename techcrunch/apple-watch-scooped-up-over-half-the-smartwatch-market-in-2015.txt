Despite alate arrival to the wearables market, Apple claimed the top spot in terms of device sales,according to new research from Juniper out this week, which stated that the Apple Watch accounted for over 50 percent of smartwatch sales in 2015. Even more impressive is the fact Apples Watch only launched at the end of April  meaning it claimedthe majority of the market with less than a year of sales under its belt.Meanwhile, rival smartwatch platform Android Wear earned less than 10 percent of sales in 2015, the report said,even though the software now powers watches made by a numberof companies, includingHuawei, Motorola, Sony, ASUS, LG, Fossil, and others.Meanwhile,Samsungs Tizen-based Gear S2 didntachieve strong sales since its November launch, despite being well received, the report also said.Most other smartwatch sales are currently coming from cheaper, simpler devices from a range of smaller players, such as Martian, X and Razer, the latter with the recently-announced Nabu Watch, added Juniper, detailing its findings. (For what its worth, theNabu Watch is barely a smartwatch  even thecompany describes it as a digital watch with smart features.)Apples presence in the smartwatch market is also making it harderon itsrivals to compete, as evidenced this week by Fitbits crashing stock.The fitness tracker maker had unveiled its new smartwatch, the Fitbit Blazeat CES, and was immediately punished by Wall St. for daring to compete with Apple. Almost immediately, Fitbits stock dropped over 18 percent following the announcement, indicating investors lack of confidence in the device manufacturers ability to take on Apple on the high-end, as well as other established smartwatch makers further down the spectrum, such asPebble.Fitbitsstock continued to slide this week, bringing it to an all-time lowonly weeks after it had been riding a post-holiday high. (The earlier bump was due to the discovery that its Fitbit app had risen to the top of the App Store  which likely meant great holiday sales.)However, just because Apple isrunning away with the lead thanks to its 52 percent market share, that doesnt mean the smartwatch market itself is anywhere near established, Juniper also warned in its report.The smartwatch is now a category waiting for a market, wroteJuniper research analystJames Moar. Newer devices have offered more polished looks and subtly different functions, but no large changes in device capabilities or usage. With smartwatch functions established, it is now up to consumers to decide if they want them, rather than technology companies providing more reasons.In other words, the future of the market is in the hands of consumers  who may or may not feel the need for wrist-worn technology to invade their lives.Junipers findings backed up earlier research from IDC, which also said Apple would lead the smartwatch space in 2015, with Android Wear coming in a distant second. IDC had actually estimated that Apples share would be higher at 61.3 percent, versus Android Wears 15.2 percent share.Pebble, IDC also noted, would cede market share to both Android Wear and Apples watchOS platforms, but not disappear. Samsungs Tizen, meanwhile, was pegged as the dark horse in the space, thanks to its compatibility with Android smartphones and large app selection.Additionally, IDC estimated the wearable device market would reach a total of 111.1 million units in 2016, up 44.4 percent from the 80 million units shipped in 2015.WhileJuniper and IDCs reports largely focused on smartwatches, Apples share is growing in the overall wearables market as well. Another recent report, also from IDC, hadpegged Apple as the number two wearable worldwide, coming in just behind Fitbit and gaining quickly.
